PROJMGMT Major Output: PennyWise: Your Smart Budget Companion

## Project Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to create a fully functional finance tracking application for use on Windows laptops. Within this scope, we seek to achieve the following: 
To ensure data privacy by employing either system hashing or data encryption to protect user identity and financial information. 
To efficiently host and manage the application through successfully implementing cloud storage, minimizing storage demands during installation, and enabling real-time data analysis and updates by developers.
To enhance financial literacy and budgeting skills by elaborating on and facilitating budget scheming as a more robust approach to financial management.
To incorporate user feedback by engaging with beta testers and incorporating their feedback to refine and enhance the application before its official launch.
To thoroughly test and debug the application to minimize issues before the final application launch.
